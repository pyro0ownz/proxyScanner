# proxyScanner
simple proxy scanner with sockets working but buggy will be working on it a little at a time if you do work on it make sure you fork it.
I'm also not responsible for anything you do with this as its intended to show how easy it is to code a scanner with minimal effort and yes its shitty because i'm not making an uber scanning tool for people to scan proxies to run in their crackers or scan networks for specific open ports which is why you have to compile the stuff yourself. But i am curious to see what people do with this coding since its half finished.
